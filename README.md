# Bike Sales Data Analysis Dashboard MS Excel Project

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of customer data for a bike shop. Using Excel, I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize how different demographics (income, age, commute distance) influence bike purchasing decisions.
